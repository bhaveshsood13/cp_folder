option 1 :CLEARLY YOUR HATE FOR HER : leave her ... because she is not perfect for you and she doesn't understand you and she is selfish.
            It will teach her your value and probably make her run after you.

option 2: CLEARLY YOUR LOVE FOR HER : tell her how wrong she was ..... and let it go ..just because you care about the relationship and that promise you gave her.
          but let her know that this doesn't mean ki 


          Khushi Listen , I don't think ki you realise just how wrong and hurtful you were to me today... I literally ... leave it..
          But I remember that I promised you ki I'll just not end things like this and would be willing to work out ...and this is me keeping my end of the bargain..So I choose to forgive you this once..and hope you understand my decision and my feelings...
          But I'd still like to refrain from messaging or talking to you for a while ...not because of you ..but for me...and request you to please don't message me for somewhile....i'll let you know when... but even right now...just don't message anything..
